All requirements are defined for the project developed by a single developer. If the application is
developed by 2 developers, the requirements expressed in numbers must be multiplied 2.

Basic requirements - 30% of final grade

• The system developed conforms to the description.
• The system has to be original work - developed by the student (or pair of students) and not
  downloaded from GitHub or any other source.
• System data is stored in a database (typically a SQL or NoSQL storage). If the database is
  relational, it must contain not less than 4 related tables and must be designed in 3rd normal
  form.
• The system conforms to MVC approach. User interface layer is separated from business logic
  and from data storage using appropriate MVC means.
• The system developed is non-trivial (e.g. not blog with 1 form), by adding some additional
  effort, one could create a usable web application. All 4 CRUD functions (create, read, update,
  and delete) must be implemented.
• Localization pattern is applied in the system, users can switch languages.
• The system has user authentication mechanism. Each registered user is included in some role,
  permissions are assigned to user roles. At least two roles of registered users must be
  implemented. The permissions assigned to all roles and to quest users must be different.
• User passwords are not stored in plain text.
• HTML and CSS validates. It is requirement from “Web technologies I” course.
• UTF-8 text encoding is used throughout the system.
• ”Nice URLs” are used in the system (addresses do not contain script names, e.g., index.php, GET
  parameters are not used when not appropriate).
• Version control is used (also for applications developed by a single developer). There are at
  least 3 commits with different timestamps and different functioning versions of the developed
  system. Git is expected to be used if you don't have previous experience with version control.
